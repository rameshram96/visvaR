```

\##*Example usage*

``` r
library(visvaR)
visvaR:::oneway_crd()        # one factor completely randomized design 
visvaR:::oneway_rbd()        # one factor randomized block design 
visvaR:::twoway_crd()        # two factor completely randomized design 
visvaR:::twoway_rbd()        # two factor randomized block design 
visvaR:::correlation_multi() # Correlation of multiple variables
